# ytsig (YouTube Shorts Is Garbage)

ytsig is a really simple Firefox extension that blocks YouTube shorts by
replacing the page content with one of a few phrases that remind you that
YouTube Shorts is, in fact, total garbage, and will rot your brain. ytsig is
deliberately simple and unconfigurable. Unless you disable it (which you
shouldn't), it will prevent you from wasting time on YouTube Shorts (and
nowhere else).
